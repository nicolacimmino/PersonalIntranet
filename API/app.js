// We use jade as a view engine. This is not central  to the API as we only serve JSON data but is used
// for couple of pages giving human readable information about the API. This is mainly experimental, content
// is so static that this is really not necessary.
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));

// From here we start injecting dependencies into the  express application. Each module needed by expess
// is to be injected here with the "app.use()".  NOTE: order matters, injected middleware is executed
// in the order it is provided.

// Bodyparser is middleware that takes care to parse request bodies and make them readily available in
// the request object. We make use of "JSON".json" parser  which will populate request.body if the request
// body MIME type is "application/json". We also use  ".urlencoded" which will populate request.body if
// the body MIME type is "*/x-www-form-urlencoded".  https://www.npmjs.org/package/body-parser

// cors is middleware that takes care to set the needed  response headers to implement 
// CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).  We need this as our API will be served by a certain domain but
// could be invoked by applications loaded from a different domain.  https://www.npmjs.org/package/cors
var cors = require('cors')

// on to all following handlers.

// As mentioned above the middleware injected  is executed in the order in which it's injected
// so this goes at the end of the chain and will  set the response code to 404 (not found) as none
// of the above modules has found something to do  with the requested URL. Note that since the
// function we inject here has 3 parameters it will  not match errors, errors will be caught by the

// This has a four parameter signature. We give a generic  500 (internal server error) unless 
// a specific error  was already set.
