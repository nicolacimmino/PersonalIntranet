The goal of this project is to create an intranet to collect and process personal infomation. Below is a quick rough list of features that might be incuded.

* Home rooms temperature
* Entrance door openings reports
* Presence iformation
* Expenses logging
* Exercise logging

The intranet should be made up of a backend exponsing a REST API and divese front end: a web based one offering access to pretty much all information and very specialized Android clients (e.g. reporting expenses).
